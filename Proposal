CMPUT 274

Project Title: Italian Cannon

Team members: Jiahui Wang 1497960 and Hongru Qi 1500246

Description: Two arduino connected together and use a protocal to set a server and
client. server will decide when the game will begin. when the game start, two people
with cannon will show on both side, with health point above their head. the wind
speed and direction will show in the up middle of the screen and change each round.
Server will shoot first, use joystick to set the angle and initial speed of the
bullet. Then press joystick to fire, if the bullet hit the enemy, the HP decrease.
Then it's client player's round.


Milestones:
1.	Nov 17
    write the protocal for set server and client, the start page of both machine
    the start button and everything before game start.

2.	Nov 24
    draw cannon HP on both side, write the parabola algorithm for the bullet moving
    add joystick in to change angle and initial speed

3.	Nov 28
    add wind speed in the game. add a wall in the middle.

4.	Dec 2
    add final state in the game(win or lose), go back to start page. improve
    algorithm to increase the operating speed.
