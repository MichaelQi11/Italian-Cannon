Running Instructions:
1. Wire two Arduino Mega Boards as stated above and connect both to a computer
2. Make upload ItalianCannon.cpp to both boards
3. Restart the board if the start menu is different as the description.

Description:
This game is a turn-based two player game where players can choose their favored
tank and attack opponent's tank by picking an appropriate angle and initial
speed. The side who lost all HP first will lose the game.
After uploading the code, user should see the screen of the board whose pin 13
is connected to GND shows "Wait for beginning" and the other one shows the name
of the game and an arrow pointing to "Start". Click thejoystick to get into the
next page where user is able to scroll up and down with joystick to choose who
will take the first round. In this case, "Server start" means the one that is
making choice right now start first and "Client start" means the opposite.
"Random start" will simply let the system randomly choose who will take the
first hand (StartMenu.JPG). The next page is to let both users choose their
tank. There are three tank in total, which owns different size, HP and deals
different damage. The image shows the exact size of the tank as in the game
(TankSelection.JPG). In the game, user who is taking round can choose the size
of the cannon by scrolling joystick up and down. Click joystick to confirm and
then change the angle and initial speed with the joystick and click to make a
shot. Notice that there is wind speed which will affect the initial speed. The
height of wall and wind speed will change each game based on a math algorithm
(InGame.JPG). The art of the tank is futher explained in the attached file
Tank.JPG.

Alarm:
Consider the calculating rate of Arduino Board, user may not operate too fast
(such as insanely make multiple shots on both side without changing any angle
and speed) which may cause some bug. Generally, the game is fine. If there is
bug shows up, sorry about it but please restart the board. Also, please let the
board rest for a while after long time playing when there is bug showing up if
without any inappropriate operation.

Function:


Have fun with our game ^_^
